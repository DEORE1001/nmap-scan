
Task 1 Report: Local Network Port Scanning using Nmap
Submitted by: Deore Rohit
Internship Domain: Cybersecurity
Date: 23 June 2025
Objective
The main goal of this task was to perform a port scan on my local network using Nmap to identify active hosts and open ports, which helps in understanding network exposure and basic reconnaissance.

Tools Used
Nmap – for network and port scanning

Operating System: Kali Linux

Optional Tool Considered: Wireshark (not used in this task)

Steps Performed
Installed Nmap from the official website (already available on Kali Linux by default).

Found my local IP range. Based on my current setup, the local subnet was identified as 192.168.1.0/24.

Ran the TCP SYN scan using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
Nmap scanned all 256 IPs in the subnet and identified 4 active hosts.

Recorded the IP addresses, open ports, services, and MAC addresses from the results.

Scan Results Summary
➤ Host 1: 192.168.1.1 (Syrotech Router)
Open Ports: 21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)

Filtered Port: 23 (Telnet)

MAC: 7C:A9:6B:E4:8A:5F

Comment: Common router services are exposed. SSH and Telnet can be risky if not secured.

➤ Host 2: 192.168.1.2 (Likely a Windows System)
Open Ports: 135, 139, 445, 903, 2869, 5357

MAC: D4:1B:81:F6:F7:25

Comment: NetBIOS and SMB ports are exposed which are often targeted in lateral movement or file-sharing exploits.

➤ Host 3: 192.168.1.4 (Unknown Device)
All 1000 ports closed

MAC: A2:74:78:C4:B1:56

Comment: Possibly a mobile device with no services running or strict firewall policies.

➤ Host 4: 192.168.1.8 (Another Quiet Device)
All 1000 ports closed

Comment: Likely a system with no exposed services or a well-secured device.

Observations & Learning Outcomes
Learned how to identify live hosts and their running services.

Gained understanding of what common open ports represent and the associated risks (e.g., FTP or SMB).

Understood how TCP SYN scan works and why it's often used in reconnaissance.

Improved hands-on familiarity with tools used in real-world penetration testing.

Risks Identified
Open FTP, SSH, and SMB ports can become attack vectors if weak credentials or outdated services exist.

Telnet was filtered but present — outdated protocol and should ideally be disabled.

Security Recommendations
Disable unused services on devices.

Use strong authentication and firewalls to restrict access to sensitive ports.

Regularly scan the network to identify any unexpected exposure.

Conclusion
This task helped me strengthen my understanding of internal network security, port scanning techniques, and identification of potential risks due to open services. It was a valuable step towards mastering basic reconnaissance in ethical hacking.
