===============================================

Internship Domain: Cybersecurity

Objective
---------
The main goal of this task was to perform a port scan on my local network using Nmap 
to identify active hosts and open ports, which helps in understanding network exposure 
and basic reconnaissance.

Tools Used
---------
- Nmap (Network and port scanning)
- Operating System: Kali Linux (Nmap pre-installed)
- Optional Tool Considered: Wireshark (not used in this task)

Methodology
-----------
1. Identified local IP range: 192.168.1.0/24
2. Performed TCP SYN scan using command:
   nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
3. Scanned all 256 IPs in the subnet
4. Identified 4 active hosts
5. Recorded IP addresses, open ports, services, and MAC addresses

Scan Results
------------
Host 1: 192.168.1.1 (Syrotech Router)
- Open Ports: 
  21 (FTP), 22 (SSH), 53 (DNS), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
- Filtered Port: 
  23 (Telnet)
- MAC: 7C:A9:6B:E4:8A:5F
- Comment: Common router services exposed. SSH and Telnet can be risky if not secured.

Host 2: 192.168.1.2 (Likely Windows System)
- Open Ports: 
  135, 139, 445, 903, 2869, 5357
- MAC: D4:1B:81:F6:F7:25
- Comment: NetBIOS and SMB ports exposed (common targets for lateral movement/file-sharing exploits)

Host 3: 192.168.1.4 (Unknown Device)
- Status: All 1000 ports closed
- MAC: A2:74:78:C4:B1:56
- Comment: Possibly a mobile device with no services running or strict firewall policies

Host 4: 192.168.1.8 (Unknown Device)
- Status: All 1000 ports closed
- Comment: Likely a system with no exposed services or well-secured device

Key Observations
---------------
- Learned to identify live hosts and running services
- Understood common open ports and associated risks (FTP, SMB, etc.)
- Gained practical knowledge of TCP SYN scan methodology
- Improved hands-on experience with penetration testing tools

Identified Risks
----------------
1. Open FTP, SSH, and SMB ports could become attack vectors with weak credentials
2. Telnet service filtered but present (outdated protocol, security risk)
3. Windows system exposing NetBIOS/SMB ports (common attack surface)

Security Recommendations
------------------------
1. Disable unused services on all network devices
2. Implement strong authentication for exposed services
3. Configure firewalls to restrict access to sensitive ports
4. Regularly scan network to monitor for unexpected exposures
5. Disable Telnet completely (use SSH instead)
6. Apply security patches for services like SMB

Conclusion
----------
This exercise provided valuable experience in:
- Internal network security assessment
- Practical port scanning techniques
- Identification of potential security risks
- Basic reconnaissance methodology

The task significantly contributed to my understanding of ethical hacking fundamentals 
and network security analysis.
